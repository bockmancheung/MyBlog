## True area in philosophy 02/19/2023

There is but one truly serious philosophical area, and that is existentialism. Deciding whether or not men's life have a meaning is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy. All other questions follow from that.

利申：My favorite existential philosophers are Nietzsche, Camus and Sartre. (Does Dostovesky count as one?)
