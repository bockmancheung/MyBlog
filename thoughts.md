## Writing myself out of turmoil of thoughts at 1am (08/30/2023)

Postscript: I don't originally intend to let this piece of writing be read by anyone else but forever be buried in my diary book, so the paragraphs below are my thoughts, unorganized and is not necessarily rational. It is my attempt to find reconciliation in myself so I'm writing essentially for myself. But I feel like many people do have similar anxieties and realizations about the nature of life, and as Emerson said we see our rejected thoughts coming back in an alienated majesty in great works, I do want to let this voice be heard by others, and perhaps act as a smoothing comfort for those who're also thoughtful of this topic, so they can know they're not alone. Finally I think it's also great if I can have my thoughts published, so I can keep this record of my thoughts, and in the future, I will remember: I have come through this. 

I found myself in dire need of reconciliation of my inner state of peace. As I am writing, the movingly sad melody of Brahms' Symphony No.3 keeps ringing in my mind. I'm full of thoughts... and if I don't write them all out desperately, I'll perhaps have no peace. Although Russell said it's foolish for people to bring their thoughts into bed, I admit that I'm not a saint. This realization is plaguing my heart: everything that I know, everyone that I've interacted with, including family, friends, relatives, are going to disappear from my circle a month from now. It is not that it's hard to make new relationships, but that all the surroundings at this moment will no longer be processed by me. I'm living the philosophy of "Treating every day as the last day of my life." Is all but a dream? Everything is doomed to fall off in one day. I have lived for 17 years, and in these years I witnessed how a person turned from a young lad into a frail old man. I witnessed how things that had been taken for granted, such as relationships, trust from friends, can vanish. What do I truly process in this world? I can envision myself as a successful math student in 2 years: acing graduate classes and making new social circles and enjoying hobbies I like, but alas, this vision means nothing to me at this moment, for if everything is so predictable, what else can I expect? Planning in life seems to have played a joke on me... Before, I would be unprepared of what is to come, but I will not feel underwhelmed or a sense of disattachment or indifference. Now that I know with a fair amount of certainty where I'm headed, I suddenly feel a loss of meaning. I have no choice to regret, and I cannot allow myself to regret anything, for they belong to the past and I know now how the course of events is bound to happen. Before I'd think every question must have some sort of andwer, but now I'm touching on something that really is irreducible, incompressible, and final. Is this absurdity really inconciliable? Camus teaches us to embrace it and rebel like Sisyphus. We're doomed to be Satan in Paradise Lost:

> All is not lost; the unconquerable will and the study of revenge, immortal hate, and courage never to submit or yield, and what else is not to be overcome?

Our unconquerable will to life amidst the universe of death and courage never to submit or yield must still persist, as it is the only way to continue living like a man, albeit we must see it with a kind of naivety that we can still have hope. I'm an existentialist outside, yet I cannot claim that I'm not nihilistic in my heart... I remember the Wordsworthseque idea that we construct and let our hearts dwell in the unbreakable building of the happy memories, and when difficult times come, rely on them to unapologetically hold our invincible summer amidst the darkest winter...

## 無題 (07/15/2023)

The dusk of July in Hong Kong depresses the undepressed, wearies the unwearied. When the whole week is sunny, storing massive amounts of heat to the point where the air is unbearably humid, there is a shower that will purify the air, purify laboring living beings. But you are not purified. The sun disappears amidst the darkening sky, with about an hour remaining before complete darkness. In such moments, my perception of time lengthens. I feel that I will never live to see the rising sun. The sun is hope, and hope becomes so sacredly rare. I find myself thrown into a desert of prospering buildings in a desolate universe, with the right road completely lost. These are moments I have to constantly draw wisdom from Hemingway’s Santiago in The Old Man and the Sea to find myself a purpose. “‘But man is not made for defeat,’ he said, ‘A man can be destroyed but not defeated,’” If there is a string that vibrates in my heart to balance out the depressing thoughts of the realization of the absurd, it is Hemingway.



## 讀季羡林《站在胡適之先生墓前》(04/15/2023)

我讀季羡林《站在胡適之先生墓前》，心中正如季羡林當日站在五十年前見最後一面的胡適之先生墓前，浮想聯翩。民國的泰斗上承康有爲、梁啓超等維新君子，到五四年間的胡適之、陳寅恪，下至季羡林、饒宗頤等二十一世紀初逝世的國學家，風雲變遷百餘年，往事如雲如煙，這些人全已駕鶴西游，但讀季羡林文章，又歷歷如在目前。我想像胡適之先生站在我前，露出那有魅力的典型的「我的朋友」式的笑容，中華百年歷史依稀縮為一刹那，歷史仿佛沒有移動。但是，一定神兒，又記得這些教授已經作古多年，我心中只能悠然神往之，希望他們治學的精神、學無止境的態度能夠成爲我這個不甚聰敏、不甚堅持的人的勉勵。

## 尋找意義 (04/13/2023)

我前十七年多的人生雖然也不乏趣味，但整體而言算是無風無浪，有點兒平凡過頭了。我該爲我的人生做些什麽呢？這世間又有什麽意義，值得追求的事情？

我以前以成績和身外物立命，視之為生命的意義，但如今成績是有點了，環顧四周，比我成績更好的大有人在，而且即使成績好，也從不代表自己擁有真正的知識和受過真正的思維教育。至於身外物，我也看得淡了。比如感情，這些也講究時機要對，雙方要情投意合，受得起時間考驗。所以身外物之所以叫身外物就是因爲沒了也行，有了只是錦上添花。我看，真正對我重要的東西只有兩個：家人和健康。

還有什麽值得我付出的事？我思前想後，現在自己還年輕，雙親健在，健康算是最不用擔心的事情了，我在這個世界孕育之下能平穩長大，已經沒有什麽要向這個世界要的東西了。倒不如問自己：究竟我可以爲這個世界做點什麽？我沒有用「國家」或者「民族」之類的詞語而是「世界」，是因爲我覺得這個地球大家都有份參與，不需要區分什麽的。改變我最初要探索的問題以後，我眼前闊然開朗。人快樂的最高境界是看見別人快樂而快樂，這種快樂是無我的：就像一輯盡顯大自然壯麗的紀錄片，大家記得的是畫面有多漂亮，卻不會記得背後攝影師的付出。我自己出生不用挨餓，又有一條接受高等教育的途徑，算是比世上許多人優越的了。如果自己能夠讓他人的生活改善，而且能兼顧到他們的尊嚴，我想是最好的。但退一萬步來説，以現在人類面對的最大存在危機：核戰和全球暖化，如果我們不切實改變這些問題，不用數百年，我們不要說過上好生活，連要生存也難吧！因此我找到我的立身之本，我的存在意義是怎樣能夠改變人類的未來，把接近不可能逆轉的危機逆轉。在這個意義上，我前十七年多的人生根本沒有活過，我的生命才剛開始。前方縱使驚濤駭浪，我也會一往無前，為我的理想揮灑熱血，與命運奮鬥。

一位滿腔熱誠的年青人，二零二三年四月十三日於香港。
