Does the Godel 2nd incompleteness theorem apply to the (non-exhaustability/non-provability) of the consistency of a linguistic theory from the general properties of cognition and from laws of nature? To what extent can we describe linguistics theory using logic terms?

## Non-academic benefits of studying linguistics 02/13/2023

1. Train a mindset to expose debased language of the media. To tell truths and expose lies. (although it is fine if you have common sense.)

2. Aware of the stereotypes framed by the use of language (since language is influenced by culture) and refine and gain diginity to your thoughts

3. Language is highly psychological and cultural - study of human language may contribute to a humanistic social science that will serve as an instrument for social action.

### Postscriptum 

My friend wrote this passage:

I kinda feel bad for not having interest in modern linguistics (beyond phonology, syntax and semantics, that is)
now I have MIT opencourseware playlist, I think I can at least gain the basic terminology and ask myself the right questions, instead of just saying "haha glottal ejective nonexistent haha 5-dimensional syntax trees."

Now that I've been introduced into modern social/cultural theories by you (via Chomsky), I think there's much more to linguistics that I think there is. (Chomsky's time was the time where linguistics was considered "an ending field of study", so I could just imagine how much more there is if it doesn't simply end there. like classical => quantum in physics.)
