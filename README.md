# MyBlog

Hi, welcome to my blog.

My thoughts are very roughly categorized (I know it is impossible to completely categorize it strictly) to each #.md# file. 
To help readers understand my thoughts (and let me better organize myself), I will attach #keywords# under each post so further research can be done.

I have to admit that in fact, you may notice that some of the posts here are merely illformed thoughts, but anyways that's how our thoughts work: fragments that are not supposed to be spoken out, and occurs in a flash of the mind. I just want to document my thoughts here during my study progress so 1. These thoughts will not die in me and left unexpressed, 2. These thoughts might turn out to have profound insights which is useful for researchers/experts in their respective fields.

Please reach bockmacheung@gmail.com if you find anything interesting in the blog and want to chat with me.
