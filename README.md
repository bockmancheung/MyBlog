# MyBlog

Hi, welcome to my blog.

My thoughts are very roughly categorized (I know it is impossible to completely categorize it strictly) to each #.md# file. 

I have to admit that in fact, you may notice that some of the posts here are merely illformed because they're my thoughts, and thoughts are fragmented. I just want to document my thoughts here during my study progress so 1. these thoughts will not die in me and left unexpressed, 2. I invite readers to perform on me a psychoanalysis so I can know more about myself.

I sometimes will summarize important ideas and theories in my blog posts too.

Please email bockmacheung@gmail.com to reach me out.
