# MyBlog

Hi, welcome to my blog. My name is Bock Man and I'm an incoming freshman at UCLA.

My thoughts are very roughly categorized. 

You may notice that some of the posts here are merely illformed because they're my thoughts, and thoughts are fragmented. I just want to document them here so 1. these thoughts will not die in me and left unexpressed, 2. I invite readers to perform on me a psychoanalysis so I can know more about myself.


Please email bockmacheung@gmail.com to reach me out.
