# 11/02/2023 Doctrine of Chomsky's Political Activism

## 1. Anarchism 

What is anarchism? It is a political thought that, as the anarchist historian Rudolf Rocker put it, "strives for the free unhindered unfolding of all the individual and social forces in life," combining the best of socialism and liberalism.

There are multiple traces of Chomsky's work and thinking that contribute to his position as an anarchist. For example, from his "cognitive revolution" of modern linguistics, he believes that language is innate to human nature†, and "our language faculty and aspects of our moral sense are putatively innate". In other words, what is intrinsic to human nature is the "desire to create under conditions of freedom and lack of constraint" (See his essay, *Language and Freedom* (1970)). Perhaps that is the major connection of his celebrated contributions in linugistics to politics. He seeks to "free individuals from oppresion", and through "the intensive study of one aspect of human psychology - human language - may contribute to a humanistic social science tahat will server , as well, as an instrument for social action."

† He claims that language as a "mental organ", see I-languages and E-languages, competence-performance dichotomy for more. 

Russell summarizes the insights into his position into a innate human nature fairly well:

>  How comes it that human beings, whose contacts with the world are brief and personal and limited, are nevertheless able to know as much as they do know?

§ Anarchism, unlike capitalism or socialism or communism, haven't been carried out in a large scale yet, but for examples, check the anarcho-syndicalist movement in Spain before the Spainish Civil War, Kibbutzim in early days of Israel, and the workers' councils in former Yugoslavia.

> Liberty without socialism is privilege, injustice; ... socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality. - Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin (Russian revolutionary anarchist)

## 2. Enlightment liberalism (The Encyclopédie)

Chomsky has a clear affinity with the Encyclopédies of the eighteenth century, with figures like Denis Diderot, Rousseau and Voltaire. The Encyclopédies is founded on the assumption that "the truth speaks for itself", if "you present people with the facts they will automatically be persuaded of the truth". Chomsky believes that the availability of the truth is a necessary prerequisite to establishing any kind of decent society, and what he does is "provide ...  service to popular dissident movements and scattered individuals" who are trying to oppose the power of corporate propaganda and indoctrination. To summarize very briefly, his hope is that the availablility of information about the actions of the elits will lead to orgaization and popular activism that opposes them and begins to build a better society.

In the next blog I will write about how citizens of democratic countries' are being exploited and even in radical terms, enslaved by state governments, transnational corporations and other sectors which has inevitably entangled with the state in various ways, for example the entertainment industry, the corporate media and the public relations industry.
