## Math Goals, May to August 2023

1. Algebra (Aluffi), this book takes algebra in a category theory approach that is immensely intriguing.
2. (Baby level) Analysis (Rudin, Bloch), I'm not studying too deep since I consider studying applied math more.
3. PDE (Strauss), this will prepare me to study environmental science & physics at UCLA
